# `Katakana`

`Katakana` is a straightforward and user-friendly Python wrapper designed for `OSINT` tasks. It provides an easy-to-use interface for various `OSINT` operations, even though it's a `WIP`.

(I'm probably _never_ gonna finish this, I mean never.)

## Usage

```python
from katakana import LookupRunner, LookupType

runner = LookupRunner(discord_token="Your token, this isn't required.")
result = runner.run_lookup(...)
```
